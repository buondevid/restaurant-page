This website was created using only HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JS.\
It's completely responsive on any mobile, it has simple transitions and a Google Map snippet.

It's written in *Modular Javascript* using **Webpack** as bundler.
The goal of the project was to meet Webpack and start using it. In the end, I decided to learn **SASS** as well, and use it for this project.
